# Piwigo OpenID Connect plugin

OpenID Connect is a Piwigo plugin which allows single sign-on logins using the
OpenID Connect protocol. The protocol utilizes both the OpenID Connect Core and
the OpenID Connect Discovery specifications. The plugin supports both the
authorization code flow, as well as the (legacy) resource owner credentials
flow, otherwise known as the password flow. Although legacy and recommended
against, by enabling this flow, login through the Piwigo webservice API is
enabled.

Special thanks to jumbojett for the OpenID Connect library used in this plugin.
